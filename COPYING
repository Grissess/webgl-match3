Note that not all img/ files are present due to copyright encumbrance:

- n.*, o.*, r.*, t*, h.*, u.*, g.*: My work, using the Impact Condensed font.
  If that font is not encumbered, I make it available under CC0.

- gem.*, cherries.*, coin*: My work. Available under CC0.

- dragon* (my favorite tileset) was copyright Sandara (as identified on
  Deviantart) for gamermats.com, and is not included at the request of the
  copyright holder ("Please do not use.").

- casper.jpg, collins.jpg, hunter.jpg, lynch.jpg, maciel17.jpg, matthews.gif,
  tamon.jpg: Likenesses of natural persons; not included since their consent
  was not obtained.

You should edit the tilesets in game.js accordingly; the code is available
unmodified so as to be a faithful reproduction of the hosted version, and for
pedagogic purposes. If you are worried about copyright compliance, the best
course of action is likely to insert your own assets into img/, and use that as
the only tileset. The CC0 license is available in the file CC0 in the root of
this repository.
